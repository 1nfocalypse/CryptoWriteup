# Contributing

Thank you for checking out the contributing file! I'm excited to see what changes you bring to the project, and hopefully we can get this writeup to be more comprehensive as a group effort!

## Goal
The goal of this project is to serve as a relatively accessible point of reference for those interested in the math behind cryptography. As such, please write your explanations as if you are attempting to explain it to perhaps a first year undergraduate CS student.
It's okay to use advanced math or advanced concepts, so long as they are explained appropriately and in a way understandable to the target audience. It is also very important that if you are contributing something, please include the actual math, rather than simply a description of it. 
This can be foregone in certain cases where the mathematics requires a large amount of background that cannot be reasonably covered with brevity, however, this will be decided on a case-by-case basis.

## Standards
Mathematical notation should be utilized. Please use the LaTeX markup available to do this. Graphics are also nice, but not mandatory. Please explain any symbols that may be unfamilair to somebody, as is done in the background section of the writeup.
Please keep commits clean and somewhat formal. This is intended to be an educational document, and PR's containing profanity, insensitive materials, or material pertaining to malicious use will not be approved.
Utilization of the format provided is also expected. Changes to the structure will be considered, however, if it is deemed unnecessary, the PR will be rejected.

Please provide relevant resources as well, and if you suggest practice problems, please provide some suggested solutions.
Any case not covered by these standards will be judged on a case-by-case basis, and added in addendum to this document afterwards.

## Implementations
Implementations are welcome, and a repo to an implementation, so long as it is *your* implementation, are encouraged. Feel free to use any language that you desire, so long as it displays the mathematics behind the cryptography. Toy or practical implementations are acceptable.
