## Shift Ciphers
### Question 1:
There is a shift cipher known as ROT13. ROT13 can be defined as taking an input in the form of a string, converting it to the numerical representation as described by the mapping in the readme, and adding 13 to it modulo 26.

#### Part A:
Show that $E_{K}$ and $D_{K}$ are the same. Why is this? Demonstrate it for the general case.

#### Part B:
Find the key (number of shifts) utilized in the ciphertext here: Svyfcu pfli jfclkzfe.
